# Serverless with Cloud Functions
This repository serves as a template for setting up a serverless infrastructure using cloud functions. It provides guidelines for creating and setting up a GitHub repository for cloud functions.

##Cloud Functions
Cloud Functions are single-purpose, event-driven functions that are hosted on a serverless platform. They can be triggered by various cloud services, such as storage changes, HTTP requests, or pub/sub messages.


##Create & Setup GitHub Repository for Cloud Functions
Create a new private GitHub repository:

##Create a new private repository within the GitHub organization you've established.
The repository name must be serverless.
Update README.md

After creating the repository, update the README.md file with relevant information, guidelines, and instructions.
Fork the Repository:

Fork the GitHub repository into your namespace. This fork will be used for all development work.

##Build and Deploy Instructions:-
	Clone the Repository:  git clone <repository-url>
	Navigate to the Project Directory: cd <project-directory>
	
##Uploading Code to Cloud Storage

	To deploy your cloud function, you need to package your code into a zip file and upload it to a cloud storage bucket. Here's how you can do it:

	Package your code:

		Organize your cloud function code into appropriate directories.
		Create a script or use a build tool to package your code into a zip file.

	Upload to Cloud Storage:

		Choose a cloud storage bucket where you want to store your cloud function code.
		Use the cloud provider's SDK or command-line tools to upload the zip file to the selected bucket.

	Specify Bucket ID in Terraform Infrastructure Code:

		If you're using Terraform to manage your infrastructure, specify the bucket ID in your Terraform configuration.
		Use Terraform variables to make the bucket ID configurable and provide flexibility.
